title: About My Work
---

Although I can do other things, nearly all of my programming work is in
web development. In the past, I've done a lot of [Python][1] and [PHP][2] work,
but nearly everything I do these days is with [Ruby on Rails][3]. I spend most
of my free coding time tinkering with [Elixir][4] but I'm not yet proficient with it.

While I work hard to keep up with the latest trends in technology, what matters most to me is simple, old-school craftsmanship. I love well-crafted things of all sorts, and I entered this industry so that I could build things that I am proud of.

## Current Gig ##

I work in the [The Garage][5], an internal startup incubator at [UnitedHealth][6].

## Availability ##

My job keeps me pretty busy, but I might have room in my schedule for small freelance projects.
