title: About Me

**Greetings! I'm Stephen.** I live and work in the Twin Cities. It's a nice place; you should visit sometime.

I grew up in the town where I was born: Spartanburg South Carolina. After graduating from high school I had no idea what to do, so I went to college, where I learned about
computer programming and systems administration. After graduating, I moved up to
Minneapolis to teach computer literacy with [The Lutheran Volunteer Corps][1], then
started working as a software developer. I've been here ever since.

When I'm not coding, I'm probably busy woodworking and building musical instruments. One of these days, I'll get some pictures of my projects online.
